# Project - Health-Management-System-(Python)

The core concept of this project revolves around:

• Recording food consumption by individuals with precise timestamps. \n
• Tracking exercises performed by individuals with precise timestamps.
• Facilitating the extraction of logged exercise and food data as required.

The program operates continuously due to the utilization of an infinite while loop. Essentially, it functions as a ledger for logging and retrieving information regarding food consumption and exercise activities. This project primarily utilizes File I/O concepts for implementation.
